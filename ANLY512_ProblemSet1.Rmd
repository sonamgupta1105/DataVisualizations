## Rmarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and be sure to download the [**Rmarkdown Cheatsheet**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) developed by Rstudio.  A more detailed reference guide to Rmarkdown can be obtained [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)

Rmarkdown is run on a package called `knitr()`.  `knitr()` is a powerful tool for creating reports and summaries of your quantiative research, and it is an important part of a **reproducible research** toolbox.  The `Knitr` package was developed by [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/knitr/) a statistics Ph.D. who now works at Rstudio.  We will discuss the subject of **reproducible research** in greater depth in two weeks.  But for now we are simply going to get comfortable with the primary reproducible research tool for `R` which is the `knitr` package.  

Since many of you are using **Rstudio** you will benefit from the tight integration which the Rstudio interface has with the `knitr` package.  For instance in the toolbar above the text editor quadrant of the Rstudio interface you will see a "Knit" button.  That essentially executes `knitr` package commands in the background allowing the user to create reports and package output without having to execute commands in the `R` console. A great resource for more details on the `knitr` package is [knitr in a knutshell](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/) by [Karl Browman](http://kbroman.org/), or for a longer exposition you could read

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Objectives

The objectives of this problem set is to orient you to a number of activities in `R`.  And to conduct a thoughtful exercise in appreciating the importance of data visualization.  For each question create a code chunk or text response that completes/answers the activity or question requested. Finally, upon completion name your final output `.html` file as: `Sonam_Gupta_ANLY512-50_LTSP2016.html` and upload it to the "Problem Set 1"" assignment on Moodle.


## Questions

1. Anscombes quartet is a set of 4 $x,y$ data sets that were published by *Francis Anscombe* in a 1973 paper [*Graphs in statistical analysis*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682899?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).  For this first question load the `anscombe` data that is part of the `library(datasets)` in `R`.  And assign that data to a new object called `data`.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data <- anscombe
```

2. Summarise the data by calculating the mean, variance, for each column and the correlation between each pair (eg. x1 and y1, x2 and y2, etc) (Hint: use the `fBasics()` package!)
```{r}
dataDf <- data.frame(data)
library(fBasics)
# mean of every column
colAvgs(dataDf) 
# variance of every column
colVars(dataDf)

#colMeans(dataDf) #gives means for each column in the dataframe created above #one more way to do the same task 

#correlations between pairs:
cor(dataDf$x1, dataDf$y1)
cor(dataDf$x2, dataDf$y2)
cor(dataDf$x3, dataDf$y3)
cor(dataDf$x4, dataDf$y4)
```

3. Create scatter plots for each $x, y$ pair of data.
```{r}
plot(dataDf$x1, dataDf$y1)
plot(dataDf$x2, dataDf$y2)
plot(dataDf$x3, dataDf$y3)
plot(dataDf$x4, dataDf$y4)
```

4. Now change the symbols on the scatter plots to solid circles and plot them together as a 4 panel graphic
```{r}
#Using ggplot2 package since it allows to create multiple plots at the same time
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
plot1 <-  ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x1, y1))
plot2 <-  ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x2, y2))
plot3 <-  ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x3, y3))
plot4 <-  ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x4, y4))
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, top = "Anscombe's Scatter PLots")
```

5. Now fit a linear model to each data set using the `lm()` function.
```{r}
lm(formula = y1 ~ x1, dataDf)
lm(formula = y2 ~ x2, dataDf)
lm(formula = y3 ~ x3, dataDf)
lm(formula = y4 ~ x4, dataDf)
```
6. Now combine the last two tasks.  Create a four panel scatter plot matrix that has both the data points and the regression lines. (hint: the model objects will carry over chunks!)
```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x1, y1)) + geom_abline(intercept = 3, slope = 0.5)
plot1
plot2 <- ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x2, y2)) + geom_abline(intercept = 3, slope = 0.5)
plot2
plot3 <- ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x3, y3)) + geom_abline(intercept = 3, slope = 0.49)
plot3
plot4 <- ggplot(dataDf) + geom_point(aes(x4, y4)) + geom_abline(intercept = 3, slope = 0.49)
plot4
```

7.  Now compare the model fits for each model object.
```{r, results="asis"}
library("stargazer")
stargazer(dataDf, type = "text")

```

8. In text, summarize the lesson of Anscombe's Quartet and what it says about the value of data visualization.

To summarize what I learned from Anscombes Quartet is that,reading from the statistics table does not always give the complete ore desired information about the statistics of the data. Visualizations on the other hand provides you with a graphical representation of what your data is like and what all features it has. Outlier detection becomes really easy with plots and other visualizations.
